# SnapStory: Image Caption Generator 📸

SnapStory is an image caption generator tool that automatically generates captions for uploaded images. Leveraging the Flickr dataset 📊, where each image is paired with five captions, the model produces descriptive and engaging descriptions of the images. Explore the fascinating world of image captioning with SnapStory! 🎨🔍

## Features 🚀

- **Image Caption Generation:** Automatically generates captions for uploaded images.
- **Flickr Dataset Utilization:** Trained on the Flickr dataset, ensuring diverse and descriptive captions.
- **LSTM Model:** Employs a Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture for effective caption generation.
- **Supports Various Image Formats:** Accepts images in JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats.

## How it Works 🛠️

1. **Upload Image:** Choose an image from your device to generate a caption.
2. **Caption Generation:** The uploaded image is processed, and its features are extracted using the MobileNetV2 model. The LSTM model then generates a caption for the image.
3. **Display Caption:** The generated caption is displayed alongside the uploaded image.

## Limitations ⚠️

While SnapStory is highly effective in generating captions for images from the Flickr dataset, it may occasionally produce inaccurate results for new or uncommon images.

## Dataset 📊

The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset). This dataset comprises over 8,000 images, each paired with five captions.
